![Firewall Rule]({{ "/assets/firewall.PNG" | AddiIgneel.github.io/assets/firewall.PNG }})

![Firewall Rule]({{ "/assets/firewall_1.PNG" | https://AddiIgneel.github.io/assets/firewall_1.PNG }})

4. Now go to Compute Engine. Select Images and then create Image. Fill the next form as shown in picture below. Image will take 10-15 minutes to be created. Source : Cloud Storage File .... Cloud Storage File: cs231n-files/cs231n_image.tar.gz

![Image Creation]({{ "/assets/image.PNG" | https://AddiIgneel.github.io/assets/image.PNG }})

5. Click on storage from the left column and then browse. Click on Create Bucket. Enter name and Choose Regional option. 

![Storage]({{ "/assets/storage.PNG" | https://AddiIgneel.github.io/assets/storage.PNG }})

![Storage]({{ "/assets/storage_1.PNG" | https://AddiIgneel.github.io/assets/storage_1.PNG }})

6. Upload the "setting.zip" file to this bucket. The file can be downloaded from following link : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-hPhx2khRu5SqALow0T3VkmOnZTKepGu

7. Go to compute engine and then VM Instances. Click on create new instance. Select region as "Us-East1-d" Select the RAM, CPU you like. Click customize and select GPU as shown below. 

![Instance Creation]({{ "/assets/instance_1.PNG" | https://AddiIgneel.github.io/assets/instance_1.PNG }})

8. Select change button shown in boot disk column. Select Custom Images. Select the image created in step 4. 

![Instance Creation]({{ "/assets/instance_2.PNG" | https://AddiIgneel.github.io/assets/instance_2.PNG }})

9. Scroll down and select the tick box next to "Allow HTTP traffic and Allow HTTPS traffic"

10. Click on Management,Disks,Networking blue bar. Select Networking and type jupyter in Network Tag field as shown below.

![Instance Creation]({{ "/assets/instance_3.PNG" | https://AddiIgneel.github.io/assets/instance_3.PNG }})


11. Click on create Instance. 

12. Once the instance is launched. Click on ssh to launch the instance.

13. Create a new file with following command : "nano script.sh" and paste the following contents in it. Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V works on terminal window.
      
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Checking for CUDA and installing."
        # Check for CUDA and try to install.
        if ! dpkg-query -W cuda-8-0; then
          # The 16.04 installer works with 16.10.
          curl -O http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_8.0.61-1_amd64.deb
          dpkg -i ./cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_8.0.61-1_amd64.deb
          apt-get update
          apt-get install cuda-8-0 -y
        fi
        
14. Use Ctrl+X and then Y to save the file.

15. Run the following command: chmod +x script.sh

16. Run the script by : sudo ./script.sh

17. Wait for the latest GPU drivers to be installed.

18. Run the following commands to install anaconda, jupyter notebook and tensorflow.
    
    1. wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-5.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
    2. bash Anaconda2-5.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
    3. Follow the guide and type yes when it prompts you. Click enter when it asks you to appened the path.
    4. Type yes when asked to include path.
    5. source .bashrc
    6. conda create -n tensorflow
    7. source activate tensorflow
    8. wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/04/c4/ffb89dbea9e43e82665ff088fd08aa25aa93301aa8c480de278c8f576ea1/tensorflow_gpu-1.0.1-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux1_x86_64.whl#md5=c06b11dee765a99b1814ca393aaf558a
    9. pip install tensorflow_gpu-1.0.1-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux1_x86_64.whl

19. Run the following commands one by one to install gcsfuse to use the bucket we created in step 5.
    
    1. export GCSFUSE_REPO=gcsfuse-`lsb_release -c -s`
    2. echo "deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $GCSFUSE_REPO main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gcsfuse.list
    3. curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    4. sudo apt-get update
    5. sudo apt-get install gcsfuse
    
20. Now copy the setting.zip file by using following commands from bucket:
    
    1. mkdir mount
    2. gcsfuse <your bucket name> ./mount
    3. cp mount/setting.zip ./
    4. unzip setting.zip
    
21. Copy the files extracted to make sure jupyter notebook works:
      
    1. jupyter notebook --generate-config  ** the following command will print a path like /home/<your username>..../.jupyter/...
    2. copy the path till .jupyter
    3. mv mycert.pem <paste path here>
    4. mv jupyter_notebook_config.py <paste path here>
    5. jupyter notebook password ( give the password)
    6. jupyter notebook
 
   17. Go to VM instance page and copy the external IP for your instance. Open a new tab in browswer paste it and write :9999 after it. 
 
 22. Enter the password. Jupyter notebook should be working now.
    
 Dont forget to shutdown the instance.
